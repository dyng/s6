# s6

It is a non-official s6 repository.

[s6](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/index.html) is a supervision suite designed as a replacment of [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html). If you are interested in what s6 does better than other supervision suites, [this](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/why.html) post may help you.

BTW, s6 stands for **s**karnet.org's **s**mall and **s**ecure **s**upervision **s**oftware **s**uite.
